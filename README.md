# TensorFlow Study

This repository hosts the various projects that have been inspired from the book *Learning Deep Learning*. The purpose of this repository is the study of the theory and application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This is only the beginning of my study and further projects that I plan to create on my own.
